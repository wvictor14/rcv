	abstract = {Epigenetic changes regulate developmental processes such as cell differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. They also play an important role in modulating gene expression up or down in response to external (e.g., environmental) influences. Epigenetic processes in the placenta are quite distinct from other tissues, reflecting its unusual development and role as the interface between the mother and fetus. Investigation of the placental epigenome can add insight into (i) the unique aspects of placental development, including its relationship to metastatic processes in cancer; (ii) pathogenesis related to placental mediated pregnancy disorders; (iii) how in utero exposures, such as maternal nutrition, stress, drug use, and metabolic disease, can affect fetal health and long-term developmental outcomes; and (iv) possible utility in prenatal diagnosis.},

However, conflicting and inconsistent findings have obscured the role of oxygen in regulating invasive trophoblast differentiation. In this study, the effect of hypoxic, normoxic, and atmospheric oxygen on invasive extravillous pathway progression was examined using a human placental explant model. Here, we show that exposure to low oxygen enhances extravillous column outgrowth and promotes the expression of genes that align with extravillous trophoblast (EVT) lineage commitment. By contrast, super-physiological atmospheric levels of oxygen promote trophoblast proliferation while simultaneously stalling EVT progression. Low oxygen-induced EVT differentiation coincided with elevated transcriptomic levels of lysyl oxidase (\textit{LOX}) in trophoblast anchoring columns, where functional experiments established a role for LOX activity in promoting EVT column outgrowth. The findings of this work support a role for low oxygen in potentiating the differentiation of trophoblasts along the extravillous pathway. Additionally, these findings generate insight into new molecular processes controlled by oxygen during early placental development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Summary Statement{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Low oxygen promotes extravillous trophoblast differentiation{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The application of genomic approaches to placental research has opened exciting new avenues to help us understand basic biological properties of the placenta, improve prenatal screening/diagnosis, and measure effects of in utero exposures on child health outcomes. In the last decade, such large-scale genomic data (including epigenomics and transcriptomics) have become more easily accessible to researchers from many disciplines due to the increasing ease of obtaining such data and the rapidly evolving computational tools available for analysis. While the potential of large-scale studies has been widely promoted, less attention has been given to some of the challenges associated with processing and interpreting such data. We hereby share some of our experiences in assessing data quality, reproducibility, and interpretation in the context of genome-wide studies of the placenta, with the aim to improve future studies. There is rarely a single “best” approach, as that can depend on the study question and sample cohort. However, being consistent, thoroughly assessing potential confounders in the data, and communicating key variables in the methods section of the manuscript are critically important to help researchers to collaborate and build on each other's work.},

	abstract = {The human pan-tissue epigenetic clock is widely used for estimating age across the entire lifespan, but it does not lend itself well to estimating gestational age (GA) based on placental DNAm methylation (DNAm) data. We replicate previous findings demonstrating a strong correlation between GA and genome-wide DNAm changes. Using substantially more DNAm arrays (n=1,102 in the training set) than a previous study, we present three new placental epigenetic clocks: 1) a robust placental clock (RPC) which is unaffected by common pregnancy complications (e.g., gestational diabetes, preeclampsia), and 2) a control placental clock (CPC) constructed using placental samples from pregnancies without known placental pathology, and 3) a refined RPC for uncomplicated term pregnancies. These placental clocks are highly accurate estimators of GA based on placental tissue; e.g., predicted GA based on RPC is highly correlated with actual GA (r{\textgreater}0.95 in test data, median error less than one week). We show that epigenetic clocks derived from cord blood or other tissues do not accurately estimate GA in placental samples. While fundamentally different from Horvath’s pan-tissue epigenetic clock, placental clocks closely track fetal age during development and may have interesting applications.},

Yet confounding from population stratification is often unaccounted for in DNAme association studies. Existing approaches to address confounding by population stratification using DNAme data may not generalize to populations or tissues outside those in which they were developed. To aid future placental DNAme studies in assessing population stratification, we developed an ethnicity classifier, PlaNET (Placental DNAme Elastic Net Ethnicity Tool), using five cohorts with Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChip array (HM450k) data from placental samples that is also compatible with the newer EPIC platform.},
